## DoneGo Food Delivery app
### About Website
The main goal of this app is to clone the pixel-perfect design of Dunzo. The app is solely dedicated to food delivery, and does not own any shops or restaurants. A customer can browse and order anything that is available on the store’s online menu, and Donego delivery partners will deliver the items ordered. The app is basically for times, when the customer doesn’t want to go out and are too busy to do cook. Our delivery partners are extremely reliable and will carefully handle the orders while maintaining the pandemic norms, so that our customers can experience the best food their is from their home.
