# DoneGo Food Delivery app
An online food delivery platform dunzo where one can order food online, search for popular restaurants, search for restaurants located nearby, can sort the items by popularity-high to low, delivery rating and can also filter item according to cuisines, cost and ratings.
### About Website
The main goal of this app is to clone the pixel-perfect design of Dunzo. The app is solely dedicated to food delivery, and does not own any shops or restaurants. A customer can browse and order anything that is available on the store’s online menu, and Donego delivery partners will deliver the items ordered. The app is basically for times, when the customer doesn’t want to go out and are too busy to do cook. Our delivery partners are extremely reliable and will carefully handle the orders while maintaining the pandemic norms, so that our customers can experience the best food their is from their home.
Our customers can also use this app to order available ingredients from nearby stores, for the rare times that one forgets to buy them or for when they want to cook but are too occupied to go shopping for them.
There are a variety of things one can order, from food to groceries to desserts&delicacies to medicines, and even cigarettes!
It’s times like these that Dunzo comes to your rescue. You can order it from the app and the items will be at your doorstep.
Since, nothing in the world is free, we charge minimal rates for delivery according to the rules.
